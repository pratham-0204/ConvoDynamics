You. I only have a day off on Sunday, so I have only free time. Sunday is a wonderful day for me to spend time with my friend. One of my things I really enjoy doing on Sunday morning class is to play chess. It is a time to relax and talk about the events of the previous week and future plans. On Sunday morning, I often sing with my friends at a karaoke restaurant and we all have a good time together. Bye.
